# TTAnalysis Refactoring Plan

This document outlines a comprehensive refactoring plan for the TTAnalysis application to improve code quality, maintainability, and consistency.

## Issues Identified

### 1. Styling Inconsistencies
- **Mixture of inline styles and CSS classes**: PlayerPanel uses both CSS classes and direct inline styling
- **Duplicate style definitions**: Similar styles defined in multiple components
- **Hard-coded color values**: Colors defined inline rather than using CSS variables

### 2. Component Architecture
- **ShotSelector complexity**: Component has complicated conditional logic
- **Prop drilling**: Excessive passing of props through component hierarchy
- **Lack of component modularity**: Some components have multiple responsibilities

### 3. State Management
- **Local component state**: State is managed locally in components with no centralized store
- **Complex state transitions**: Multi-step flows managed through several state variables
- **Data persistence**: Currently using localStorage with plans to move to Supabase

## Refactoring Recommendations

### 1. Styling Approach
- **Extract inline styles to CSS classes**: Move all inline styles to CSS classes
- **Create component-specific CSS modules**: Organize styles by component
- **Consider styled-components**: Add styled-components for better CSS-in-JS integration
- **Consistent use of CSS variables**: Use design tokens defined in root variables

### 2. Component Architecture
- **Break down complex components**: Split ShotSelector into smaller components
- **Create a UI component library**: For buttons, panels, cards, etc.
- **Add composition patterns**: Use component composition instead of prop drilling

### 3. State Management
- **Implement React Context**: Create contexts for match state, user settings, etc.
- **Add custom hooks**: Create hooks for common state management patterns
- **Prepare for Supabase integration**: Structure app for easier backend integration

### 4. Code Quality Improvements
- **Remove duplicate code**: Extract repeated patterns into utility functions
- **Improve type safety**: Add more specific TypeScript types
- **Add error handling**: Add proper error handling for data operations
- **Add unit tests**: Start implementing unit tests for core functionality

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Styling Consistency
1. Extract inline styles from PlayerPanel to CSS classes
2. Reorganize CSS into component-specific files
3. Standardize color usage with CSS variables

### Phase 2: Component Architecture
1. Create a UI component library for common elements
2. Refactor ShotSelector into smaller components
3. Implement composition patterns for complex UI sections

### Phase 3: State Management
1. Set up React Context for match state
2. Create custom hooks for point recording logic
3. Prepare data layer for Supabase integration

### Phase 4: Code Quality
1. Add comprehensive TypeScript types
2. Improve error handling
3. Set up testing infrastructure

## Benefits of Refactoring

- **Improved maintainability**: Easier to make changes and add features
- **Better performance**: Optimized rendering and state updates
- **Enhanced developer experience**: More intuitive codebase structure
- **Scalability**: Better foundation for adding future features
- **Consistent user experience**: More reliable UI patterns

## Measuring Success

- **Code complexity metrics**: Reduction in cyclomatic complexity
- **Bundle size**: Smaller or same-sized bundles with improved functionality
- **Performance metrics**: Improved render times and reduced layout shifts
- **Developer feedback**: Easier to understand and modify code
