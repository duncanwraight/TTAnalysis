# Match Creation Debug Summary

This document summarizes the issue and solution for the match creation functionality in the Table Tennis Analysis app.

## Problem Description

Match creation was getting stuck on "Loading" and no network request was being sent to the API server. When checking the network tab in developer tools, no request appeared when clicking the "Create Match" button.

## Root Cause

After extensive investigation, the root cause was identified as overly complex request handling with multiple layers of abstraction:

1. The original implementation used a complex chain of utilities (api.ts → form.ts → iframe)
2. The hidden iframe approach was not properly sending the request in some browser environments
3. All the abstractions made debugging difficult and added unnecessary complexity

## Solution

The successful fix involved:

1. **Direct Fetch API Usage**: Replaced all the abstractions with a simple, direct fetch request
2. **Proxy Configuration**: Added a Vite proxy configuration to handle API requests cleanly
3. **Relative URLs**: Changed all absolute URLs to relative URLs to work with the proxy
4. **Code Cleanup**: Removed all debugging code, alternative approaches, and console logs

### Final Implementation

The core of the solution is this simplified fetch request:

```javascript
const fetchResponse = await fetch('/api/matches', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    'Authorization': `Bearer ${session.access_token}`
  },
  body: JSON.stringify(matchData)
});

const responseData = await fetchResponse.json();
navigate(`/matches/${responseData.id}`);
```

## Key Changes

1. **Vite Proxy Configuration**:
   ```javascript
   server: {
     proxy: {
       '/api': {
         target: 'http://localhost:3001',
         changeOrigin: true,
       }
     },
   }
   ```

2. **Simplified API Calls**:
   - Removed multiple layers of abstraction
   - Used browser's native fetch API directly
   - Proper error handling and response processing

3. **Removed Debugging Code**:
   - Removed all console logs
   - Removed alternative implementations
   - Removed debugging components from production code

## Lessons Learned

1. **Simplicity Over Abstraction**: The simpler approach with direct fetch calls worked reliably, while complex abstractions failed.

2. **Browser Compatibility**: Hidden iframe approaches can be inconsistent across browsers and environments.

3. **Proxy Configuration**: Using Vite's proxy feature simplifies API requests and avoids CORS issues.

4. **Effective Debugging**: The ApiDebug component was instrumental in identifying the working approach.
