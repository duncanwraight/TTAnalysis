# Match Creation Debug Summary

This document summarizes all approaches attempted to fix the match creation issue in the Table Tennis Analysis app.

## Problem Description

Match creation gets stuck on "Loading" and no network request is sent to the API server. When checking the network tab in developer tools, no request appears when clicking the "Create Match" button.

## Attempted Approaches

### 1. Initial Analysis
- Identified that match creation was getting stuck on "Loading"
- Found an authentication bypass in server.js that was previously implemented
- Removed the authentication bypass and implemented proper JWT authentication

### 2. API Client Rewrite
- Completely rewrote the API client in src/lib/api.ts
- Simplified the fetchApi function with better error handling
- Added timeout controls to prevent hanging requests
- Organized API methods by entity (match, set, point, shot)

### 3. Enhanced Debug Logging
- Added comprehensive logging throughout the API client
- Added timestamps and unique request IDs for tracking
- Implemented console groups for better organization
- Added step-by-step logging to track request progress

### 4. Specialized Match Creation Implementation
- Created a "simple mode" in the API client specifically for match creation
- Reduced the code to the absolute minimum needed for a fetch request
- Removed all extra debug logging and error handling to reduce complexity
- Updated the NewMatch component to use this simplified implementation

### 5. XMLHttpRequest Approach
- Created a new utility (xhr.ts) using XMLHttpRequest instead of fetch
- Used callbacks instead of Promises
- Implemented detailed logging of the XHR state changes
- Integrated into both NewMatch and ApiDebug components

### 6. Form Submission Approach
- Created a hidden HTML form submission utility (form.ts)
- Used an iframe to capture the response
- Attempted to bypass JavaScript API issues by using native form submission
- Integrated into both NewMatch and ApiDebug components

### 7. Server Debugging
- Added debug route for testing database connection
- Added logging middleware for match creation endpoint
- Added response capture in server.js to diagnose issues

## Current State

None of these approaches resolved the issue where no network request is being made from the browser to the API server when attempting to create a match. The "Test Create Match" button in the API Debug panel seems to encounter the same issue, suggesting a deeper problem possibly related to browser security, environment configuration, or a fundamental issue with how the application is sending requests.

## Next Steps to Consider

1. Check for browser security policies that might be blocking requests
2. Examine the Supabase authentication flow more closely
3. Try with a different browser to see if the issue persists
4. Check for CORS issues in the server configuration
5. Add a native form (not JavaScript-based) to test direct form submission
6. Examine the React Router configuration for potential conflicts
7. Try using a completely different HTTP client library (like axios)
8. Test on a different machine to rule out environment-specific issues
