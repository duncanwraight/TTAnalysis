# TTAnalysis Refactoring Project

This document outlines the refactoring changes made to the TTAnalysis application to improve code quality, maintainability, and consistency.

## Refactoring Overview

The refactoring focused on several key areas:

1. **Improved Component Architecture**
   - Created reusable UI components
   - Split complex components into smaller, focused ones
   - Implemented proper component composition

2. **Consistent Styling Approach**
   - Extracted inline styles to CSS classes
   - Created component-specific CSS files
   - Standardized style variables

3. **State Management**
   - Implemented React Context for match state
   - Extracted logic from components into context
   - Added custom hooks for better state management

4. **Code Organization**
   - Reorganized file structure for better modularity
   - Created consistent naming conventions
   - Improved TypeScript typing

## Directory Structure Changes

Added or modified directories:
- `/src/components/ui/` - Reusable UI components (Button, Card)
- `/src/components/ShotSelector/` - Modular components for shot selection
- `/src/context/` - React Context providers for state management
- `/src/styles/components/` - Component-specific CSS files

## New Components

1. **UI Components**
   - `Button.tsx` - Standardized button component with variants
   - `Card.tsx` - Container component for consistent styling

2. **ShotSelector Refactoring**
   - Split into multiple components:
     - `ShotCategory.tsx` - For category tabs
     - `ShotItem.tsx` - For individual shot items
     - `ShotList.tsx` - Container for shot items
     - `types.ts` - TypeScript definitions and constants

3. **Context Implementation**
   - `MatchContext.tsx` - State management for match tracking

## CSS Improvements

1. **Component-specific CSS files**
   - `Button.css` - Styles for button variants and states
   - `Card.css` - Container styling
   - `PlayerPanel.css` - Player panel styling
   - `ShotSelector.css` - Shot selection component styling
   - `MatchTracker.css` - Page-specific styles

2. **Removed Inline Styles**
   - Extracted inline styles from PlayerPanel
   - Removed redundant style definitions
   - Standardized color usage

## Future Recommendations

1. **Testing**
   - Add unit tests for UI components
   - Test context providers with React Testing Library

2. **Performance Optimization**
   - Use React.memo for pure components
   - Add proper memoization for expensive calculations

3. **State Management Enhancements**
   - Consider moving to a more robust state management solution like Redux if the application grows

4. **Backend Integration**
   - Complete Supabase integration
   - Add proper error handling and loading states

## Migration Path

To adopt the refactored code:

1. Review the `REFACTORING.md` document for the overall approach
2. Replace existing components with their refactored versions
3. Update imports to reference the new component paths
4. Wrap the application with the MatchProvider context
5. Review CSS file structure and ensure all styles are properly imported
