# Table Tennis Match Analysis Web App

## Project Overview
Create a web application for table tennis match analysis using React with TypeScript and Supabase as the backend infrastructure.

## Tech Stack
- **Backend:** Supabase (Database, Auth, Storage)
- **Frontend:** React with TypeScript
- **Build Tool:** Vite
- **Hosting:** Supabase/Vercel/Netlify

## Implementation Plan

### 1. Supabase Setup
- Create Supabase project
- Configure authentication
- Set up database tables
- Configure RLS (Row Level Security) policies

### 2. Database Schema
- **Matches**: id, user_id, opponent_name, date, match_score, notes, initial_server
- **Sets**: id, match_id, set_number, score
- **Points**: id, set_id, point_number, winner, winning_shot, other_shot, notes
- **Users**: id, email, name, preferences (managed by Supabase Auth)

### 3. Auth Implementation
- User registration/login using Supabase Auth
- Profile management
- Session handling

### 4. Frontend Development
- Setup React project with TypeScript
- Create main UI components:
  - Match entry form
  - Point recording interface
  - Analysis dashboard
  - User profile
- Implement responsive design

### 5. Data Analysis Features
- Point win/loss analysis by shot type
- Performance trends by shot type
- Statistical summaries
- Visual representation of match flow

### 6. Component Architecture
- Create reusable UI components
- Implement proper component composition
- Use React Context for state management
- Organize CSS by component

### 7. Deployment
- Deploy to hosting provider
- Setup DNS
- Configure CORS and security headers

## Development Notes
- Use Supabase client libraries for frontend integration
- Implement proper error handling and loading states
- Focus on mobile-friendly design for courtside use
- Consider offline functionality with local storage
- Organize components with proper abstractions
- Follow consistent code style and naming conventions

## Future Enhancements
- Video integration for timestamp correlation
- Match sharing and collaboration
- Advanced statistical analysis
- Coach/player relationship management
- Multi-language support
- Dark/light theme support
