# TTAnalysis Improvements TODO

## High Priority - Functionality Issues

### Lucky Shot Feature
- [x] ~~Fix lucky shot checkbox visibility~~ **COMPLETED** - Added single "Lucky Point?" checkbox above shot selection
- [x] ~~Move lucky shot checkbox to shot selection interface~~ **COMPLETED** - Now appears immediately after winner selection
- [x] ~~Test lucky shot functionality~~ **COMPLETED** - Working correctly

**Technical Details**: Lucky shot feature now properly implemented:
- Database: `is_lucky_shot` column in points table (migration: 20250526150000_add_lucky_shot_tracking.sql)
- UI: Single "Lucky Point?" checkbox appears above Winning Shot box (MatchTracker.tsx:907-932)
- **Solution**: Added `isLuckyPoint` state that applies to winning shot when selected
- Data flow: Lucky state applied in `handleWinningShotSelect` and saved to database correctly

### Service Fault Handling
- [x] ~~Skip "other shot" selection when winning shot is service_fault~~ **COMPLETED** - Auto-records point immediately
- [x] ~~Update point recording logic to handle service fault scenarios~~ **COMPLETED** - Uses "no_shot" entry for other shot
- [x] ~~Create special case for service fault in handleWinningShotSelect~~ **COMPLETED** - Detects service_fault and records automatically

**Technical Details**: Service fault workflow now properly implemented:
- Shot exists: `service_fault` shot in serve category (migration: 20250526160000_update_serve_receive_to_service_fault.sql)
- New shot: `no_shot` entry created for service fault scenarios (migration: 20250917120000_add_no_shot_for_service_faults.sql)
- **Solution**: Modified handleWinningShotSelect to detect service_fault and auto-record point (MatchTracker.tsx:184-208)
- Logic: When service_fault selected, uses fetchShotsWithCategories to find no_shot ID and records point immediately
- Workflow: Service fault now skips "other shot" selection entirely

### Shot Categories
- [x] ~~Add "Push" shot type to "Pips" category in database~~ **COMPLETED** - Migration applied successfully
- [x] ~~Update shot selector UI to include new Push shot~~ **COMPLETED** - UI auto-updates from database

**Technical Details**: Push shot successfully added:
- Migration: 20250917130000_add_push_shot_to_pips.sql adds Push shot to Pips category
- Final order: Bump (1), Push (2), Sideswipe (3), Attack (4)
- UI automatically displays new shot since ShotSelector fetches from database dynamically
